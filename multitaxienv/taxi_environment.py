    The Taxi Problem
    from "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function Decomposition"
    by Tom Dietterich
    Description:
    There are four designated locations in the grid world indicated by R(ed), G(reen), Y(ellow), and B(lue).
    When the episode starts, the taxi starts off at a random square and the passenger is at a random location.
    The taxi drives to the passenger's location, picks up the passenger, drives to the passenger's destination
    (another one of the four specified locations), and then drops off the passenger. Once the passenger is dropped off,
    the episode ends.

    Observations:
    A list (taxis, fuels, pass_start, destinations, pass_locs):
        taxis:                  a list of coordinates of each taxi
        fuels:                  a list of fuels for each taxi
        pass_start:             a list of starting coordinates for each passenger (current position or last available)
        destinations:           a list of destination coordinates for each passenger
        passengers_locations:   a list of locations of each passenger.
                                -1 means delivered
                                0 means not picked up
                                positive number means the passenger is in the corresponding taxi number

    Passenger start: coordinates of each of these
    - -1: In a taxi
    - 0: R(ed)
    - 1: G(reen)
    - 2: Y(ellow)
    - 3: B(lue)

    Passenger location:
    - -1: delivered
    - 0: not in taxi
    - x: in taxi x (x is integer)

    Destinations: coordinates of each of these
    - 0: R(ed)
    - 1: G(reen)
    - 2: Y(ellow)
    - 3: B(lue)

    Fuel:
     - 0 to np.inf: default with 10

    Actions:
    Actions are given as a list, each element referring to one taxi's action. Each taxi has 7 actions:
    - 0: move south
    - 1: move north
    - 2: move east
    - 3: move west
    - 4: pickup passenger
    - 5: dropoff passenger
    - 6: turn engine on
    - 7: turn engine off
    - 8: standby
    - 9: refuel fuel tank


    Rewards:
    - Those are specified in the config file.

    Rendering:
    - blue: passenger
    - magenta: destination
    - yellow: empty taxi
    - green: full taxi
    - other letters (R, G, Y and B): locations for passengers and destinations
    Main class to be characterized with hyper-parameters.
